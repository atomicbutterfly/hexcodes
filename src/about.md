## About this site

Currently used for rough, unpolished posts and link roundups.

My name is Moodthy and..

- 🏠 My main blog/site is [here](http://howliteandcoffee.com). I'm a digital product designer interested in cognitive and behavioural science as well as psychology. "Why do we do that?" meets "how do we get users to do that?". My degree is in Cell and Molecular Biology, so I like to keep up with science news as it relates to health, too.
- ✍️ I've been blogging since 1998. My first website was build in 92 or 93 with notepad and tutorials from Wired's webmonkey pages. I fell in love with CSS when it was still an addendum at the end of the html specifications. While the rest of the web loved flash, I was for web standards and accessibility. I still am.
- 🧙‍♀️🍂 I love cosy life, baking, reading cosy murder fiction, and lots of vampire, werewolf and witch themed media.
- ✍️ I also write fiction (WIP). I love [IA writer](https://ia.net/writer) for blog drafts, [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview?fpr=lucas64&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAgJa6BhCOARIsAMiL7V9s5sfMXzNKEGdWUg9hI6_BDFoLji9PKZscmuWD7PlIgOaVQZ_aygoaArtxEALw_wcB) for fiction (I'm a research and notes nerd)
- 👋 say hi to me on [Mastodon](@atomicbutterfly@mastodon.social) and [BlueSky](@atomicbutterfly.bsky.social).
- 💥 I built this site using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) just for fun. A space to be imperfect, experimental and fun is necessary.
- 🌈 Thanks for reading!

You can also make your project available for other people to remix in Glitch! 🎏✨
