Everytime I try and do anything but web code - html, css, js-  I always wind up with problems in my environment. Each and every time. And it's been THE reason I don't continue, and just dabble here and there with ruby, then react, angular, django.  

That's why I miss cloud9 so much. The free, pre-amazon, version.
What's nice about Glitch is it takes away that set up and maintenace pain. 

But today I realised: I can literally ask the LLM that's owned by microsoft to help debug my python and django enviroment. It did a bang up job!

ADHD = if I can't see it on my desktop, then it doesn't exsist. So while I've archived various projects, their ghosts still haunt my bash file, which I keep forgetting about. 

So that's an actually decent use of of chatGPT. All the googling I'd done was telling me to reinstall things, and I really don't want my system cluttered more than it is.
