![first I had to delete twitter, then I saw Zuck congratulate Trump. It was too much](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExN2VuancyNzhxMDI0MHdqeXU4dTl4OHF2ZXRranNmMWR1YmZvbHg4NSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/3AIw3zQmG7ODF44qOU/giphy.webp)

I'll fill this  page out with more links as a I go.

This post's inspired by one useful link that someone shared on BlueSky today. 

 - [These alternatives to popular apps can help reclaim your online life from billionaires and surveillance](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/24/these-alternatives-to-popular-apps-can-help-reclaim-your-online-life-from-billionaires-and-surveillance/)
 
 I've been on threads since twitter announced it was for sale. At first, the lack of politics or news felt like a welcome change of pace. But now it feels like manipulation. Time to get off algorithmic feeds that float or sink of content to their liking. 
 

![anti billionaire algorithm spray. You may control the news and most social media, but you will not control how I connect with people](https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMDB0dWt1ZnhmbG53djJpdHJ4MHE5dXYwZGp5NGt1aTJlcmthZXZ5MyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/rEAdbyhgwUSIYrDf8s/giphy.webp)

 
 ## RSS is not just for blogs
The link reminded me of this Tumblr post that was doing the rounds when Twitter first announced it's sale. 
 
 - [How to keep following people when a major social platform implodes (…and you don’t want to join 20 new websites)](https://smellslikebot.tumblr.com/post/700851357933060096/how-to-keep-following-people-when-a-major-social) 
 
 It includes **how to find RSS feeds from youtube channels**, mastodon instances, tumblr blogs,  **DevientArt pages**- alas, reddit has removed it's rss feed thanks to AI scrapping it- and other tips. It gives links for **bridging sites that convert Patreon sitess** and other sites without clear RSS feeds into something you can follow. 
 
It's a good intro post to many people that RSS feeds aren't just for blogs.
 
It's solid, no frills advice (as you would expect from tumbler), but a lot of people won't hit 'ctrl + F' to find an RSS feed for youtube. 
 
 So, I would add some more links:
 
 ## Find the rss of podcasts 
 
Use [this site to find the podcast feed](https://castos.com/tools/find-podcast-rss-feed/). Because I use apple podcast, [Pocket Cast](https://pocketcasts.com/), AND [BBC sounds](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/bbc-sounds/id1380676511) apps (yes, I too rely on discovery algorithms), it's nice to have a list of *everything in one place* so I don't forget anything. 
Sometimes, you need to review and cull.

## Get Newsletters by RSS

But those million and one Substacks you signed up to that are clogging up your inbox? Those can all be followed by RSS. You don't need the Substack app to read them. It’s an app, it’s short form social feed, it’s a chatroom. It’s too much pinging during the day. 

Most RSS readers will let you copy the url of the sub stack into their “Add new feed” option and find the feed for you. Otherwise use 

 ‘https://yourfave.substack.com/feed.'

Replace "yourfave”  with the name of newsletter you want to follow.

And what about other emails? Don't you wish that you could just keep some newsletters but not have to sift through them in your inbox? You can convert those to RSS with this how-to:

- [Convert newsletters to Atom/RSS feeds](https://axbom.com/newsletter-rss-atom-feed/)
- [kill the newsletter](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/?ref=axbom.com)

## Get RSS feeds from google searches, subreddits, Facebook page

[Fetch RSS](https://fetchrss.com/) has a free tier that lets you generate 5 feeds. Beyond that you'll need a paid plan. 

## Get RSS from Insta, TikTok, Threads

[RSS.app](https://rss.app/rss-feed/create-instagram-rss-feed) is the best option for all the awkward networks that don't want to play with open protcols, but it's a paid service. 

Having said that, it's a paid service that could potentially free up a lot of space on my phone. I'm just very fond of [netnewswire](https://netnewswire.com/).
