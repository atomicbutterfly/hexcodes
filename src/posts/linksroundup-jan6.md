**In this edition:**
1. Scientists discover new blood type and change how we think of blood groups
2. Vegas nerve stimulation lasting effect on depression
3. impact of singing on mental health
4. The value of 'Imperfections'
5. Women aren't working out enough for sad reasons - not prioritising the time for it is only the second reason they cite
6. Don’t re-use single use plastic

The Official Intro:

As a behaviour designer with a background in cell and molecular biology, I explore the science of how we think, act, and adapt. But also because this video still lives in my head, rent free. 
![Human Behaviour by Bjork screenshot- subtitle reads “there’s definitely no logic to human behaviour”](https://media1.tenor.com/m/l0pE-FzIJnYAAAAd/bjork-human-behavior.gif)

**The Lore:** I started this series of roundups during the pandemic since health and mental health during lockdown were top of mind. I would share the links in Dms and discord groups and a friend suggested I start blogging them. Whenever I see a link I like I save it to obsidian. This is sort of my drafts folder here so I stay writing rather than agonising about how the cover image looks. 

### [New Blood group identified after 59 year mystery- and it changes how we think of blood groups](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-new-blood-group-after-50-year-mystery)

Finally answering how this unnamed and never before blood group type from 1972 works has caused an entire recategorisation of blood groups. Apparently the surfaces of blood groups have way more on them that the simple Rhesus factor antigens we all get taught at school. **You can think of these antigens as sort of like phone masts for different cell phone providers.**

There are other things between these cell towers: trees, buildings, etc. The 1972 patient was missing a protein that existed on every other blood group at the time - An antigen called AnWj. 


> [99.9 percent of people have the AnWj antigen that was missing from the 1972 patient's blood. This antigen lives on a myelin and lymphocyte protein, leading the researchers to call the newly described system the MAL blood group.]((https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-new-blood-group-after-50-year-mystery))

> [If people who are AnWj-negative receive AnWj-positive blood they could have a transfusion reaction, and this research allows development of new genotyping tests for detecting such rare individuals and reducing the risk of transfusion-associated complications.](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html)

So in the future, we may uncover more rare blood types because of the methods developed for solving this mystery. 


###  [Imperfections are what make art valuable](https://www.bbc.com/articles/cx2npn9ezvno)

In an age of generative AI pumping out 'perfect' images and making illustration in seconds, [the artist behind The Gruffalo reminds us that it's the imperfections in his art that make it so endearing](https://www.bbc.com/articles/cx2npn9ezvno). It reminds me of a quote that Neil Gaiman attributes to another writer, but which he said he can't find a record of, so I'm attributing it to him: _"Style is what we do wrong"_. I always hate my hand drawn sketches in my notebooks or in procreate. But later when I revisit them, I find them to have character and meaning beyond the skill level they possess. 

Says Scheffler about his illustrations 
> "I'm somebody who's not a perfect draughtsman," he says. "I think there's a certain imperfection in my drawings that might be appealing."




  ### [Women aren't working out enough for sad reasons](https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/workouts/vitality-active-women-healthy-lives-report/945343) - not prioritising the time for it is only the second reason they cite

Number 1 reason: working out is unpleasant, boring, not fun. Reason number 3 is they don't feel safe or supported enough to work out. I'll say it again, working out at home, for 10 -15 mins a time is legit. [Cosy cardio](https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cozy-cardio-workout-tiktok-trend-rcna123870) is legit.  Don't let all or nothing thinking rob us. A qoute from the article that stood out to me:

> **and the women who don't prioritise fitness? what are they prioritising?**
"over **40% who prioritise family** and **30% who focus on mental health**. This might explain why 36% of women feel guilty for taking the time for themselves to exercise (or do anything else that benefits them) – **women are putting the needs of their family and friends above their own.**"

### [Don't re-use single use plastic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/12/01/single-use-plastics-reuse-risk/)

I thought 'reusing' was good, but "plastic water bottles shed hundreds of thousands of plastic particles into the water, many of which are nanoplastics". Horrifying. _But there's more_: "Chemical exposure increases if plastic is heated, typically in a microwave, a dishwasher or even by placing hot food in a takeout containers.
Don't reheat any food in plastic, even Tupperware is the advice. Plate it and then microwave it. 

### [Stimulating the vegas nerve improves depression](https://www.sciencealert.com/vagus-nerve-stimulation-shows-lasting-effects-in-people-with-severe-depression)
**[This was done via electrodes](https://www.sciencealert.com/vagus-nerve-stimulation-shows-lasting-effects-in-people-with-severe-depression)**, not somatic yoga or meditation or singing or whatever is being touted on socials. I deep a deep dive on whether the vegas nerve could be 'stimulated' via non medical methods, but writing it up is painful. There's a lot of grifters out there, and what counts as being 'stimulated' is vague for activities that correlate with a state of relaxation. 

>[Participants were fitted with a device capable of stimulating one of their vagus nerves, which was then activated in half the group to transmit signals to areas of their brain that regulate moods](https://www.sciencealert.com/vagus-nerve-stimulation-shows-lasting-effects-in-people-with-severe-depression).

>But despite that super-high level of sustained illness, we still see statistically significant, measurable improvements in depressive symptoms, quality of life and functional outcomes."

### [Impact of singing on mental health](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxy1ee5q9ro)
While singing is my go to for anxiety, [this study is only looking at the effect of singing in a *choir*](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxy1ee5q9ro). So there could be a social aspect to the boost on mood. 
>The research found the mood of participants immediately improved by singing together and they felt calmer, more energised and happier.

>"I have observed people saying they feel more connected to each other, like they're helping and holding each other up - a sense of kinship and community, I think that's interesting."
