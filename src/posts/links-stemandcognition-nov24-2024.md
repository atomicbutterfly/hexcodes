**In this edition:**
1. Why you should stop saying "good luck", according to behaviour science
2. Venting doesn't reduce anger but this does
3. Oxytocin boosts memory, cures addiction
4. Kids learn best after watching 'impossible' events
5. Body cells may be able to contribute to memory making

Intro:

As a behaviour designer with a background in cell and molecular biology, I explore the science of how we think, act, and adapt. But also because this video lives in my head, rent free.

## ["Why you should stop saying good luck, according to behaviour science"](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/why-you-should-stop-saying-good-luck-starting-today-backed-by-behavioral-science/91020434)

**TL:DR;** Emphasising the role of luck over effort can change how people see their successes and losses as being outside their control. 

> "Saying “good luck” often enough can change the recipient’s perspective on achieving goals. A [study published in *Personality and Individual Differences*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886905001583)found that belief in luck is an adaptive cognitive process, one that could cause someone to see events more as outside of rather than within their control."

## [Venting doesn't reduce anger](https://www.sciencealert.com/venting-doesnt-reduce-anger-but-something-else-does-study-shows)

**TL:DR;** Rage rooms, venting, running and other "high arousal" activities don't reduce anger. Some activities prolonged or worsen it. Instead focus on getting calm or engaging in soothing activities.

> "The review found that most arousal-boosting activities didn't reduce anger, and some increased it, with jogging most likely to do that.""

## Oxytocin boosts memory, cures addiction

**TL:DR;** Oxytocin could be a key in how memories are formed and retained, and as such is interesting to researchers looking to treat dementia. Oxytocin affects long term memory only. Possibly explains why many believe that dementia gets worse in lonely people.

> "The team noticed that when they stimulated oxytocin neurones in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), there was increased activity not only there but also in the supramammillary nucleus (SuM)."

> "There’s also a broader social context. Many believe that loneliness and lack of social interaction can worsen [dementia symptoms](https://www.earth.com/news/dementia-was-extremely-rare-in-ancient-times-so-why-is-it-now-so-prevalent/).""

## [Kids learn best after watching impossible events](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022096521001302)

**TL:Dr;** this is one of a few follow ups from a 2011 study that concluded that fast paced cartoons affected kids cognition (kids took longer to do mental activities within 8 minutes after watching*). One of the questions in the study that the researchers acknowledged was that the "non fast paced cartoon" used in the study was less fantastical. The fast paced cartoon appears to be spongebob, in case you're wondering.

So this study was set up to test out if degrees of fantasy rather than pacing affected kids cognition. The conclusion was that degrees of fantasy did not inhibit problem solving, but that - surprisingly- **watching "impossible" events immediately before learning something educational really helped kids remember the information**.

* My two cents: ask me a question after I'm done with Spanish practice I need to space out for about ten minutes before doing anything that requires my brain. It could be we’re seeing the effects of cognitive overload in these kids rather than damage. **Having said that,** it’s worth asking if a cartoon should be using this much brain power to process, when they are calmer, more interactive options. 

## [Body cells may be able to contribute to memory making](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-11-memories-brain-human-cell.html#google_vignette)
Let's remember that cells in petri dishes don't always act like cells inside a body, first, ok? 

In this study they exposed kidney cells to sequences of chemical signals that mimics how cells are exposed to neurotransmitters and found the kidney cells switched on the same gene that brain cells do when they detect a pattern in information in order to form a memory. 

> "It suggests that in the future, we will need to treat our body more like the brain—for example, consider what our pancreas remembers about the pattern of our past meals to maintain healthy levels of blood glucose or consider what a cancer cell remembers about the pattern of chemotherapy."

Am I looking forward to people bringing up 'the body keeps the score'? No. See [here](https://leahbensontherapy.com/actually-the-body-doesnt-keep-the-score-heres-why/) and [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/08/02/body-keeps-score-grieving-brain-bessel-van-der-kolk-neuroscience-self-help/) for why.

But if the end result is that some type of body cell memory does exist from trauma, at least we'll have more science backed and evidence supported treatments.

Until next time, Stay curious!
