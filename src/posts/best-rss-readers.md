[Wired: Best rss readers](https://www.wired.com/story/best-rss-feed-readers/)

I forgot I had an inoreader account. I did like it, but it annoyed me with pestering me to upgrade.
I had a super cute and simple app called coffee RSS, but it's defunct now.

I bought reeder, but for some reason the color themes annoyed me and I couldn't get along with bionic reading, despite what people claim about it helping dyselxia. I also couldn't get it to sync feeds across other newsreader apps. The combo of things that didn't work for me kinda put me off.

So I just use netnewswire, which works ok on laptop and mobile and syncs my feeds from icloud.
