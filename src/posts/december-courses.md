Not having my kid for the first week of christmas sucked. No two ways about it. But having all that free time? A perfect moment to train and plug some knowledge gaps. 

I got both courses from Udemy on a black friday special. 

1. [Motion Design with Figma](https://www.udemy.com/course/motion-design-with-figma-animations-motion-graphics-uxui). I know how to use lottie files, but never really had the kind of budget allowance as a freelancer to get into micro interactions. Which is a bit crushing to admit, but is the truth. This course also shows you how to get the full featured educational figma account, which is worth it. 
2. [React JS](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/). Really enjoying this. It's not just that each framework makes coding easier, but also that getting older means my definition of what "hard" actually is is very different to the 20 year old version of me.
